# Milestone 1: High-Fidelity Design Development
Due: Feb 10th, 2025 

The objective of Milestone 1 is to complete and refine the low-fidelity designs created in CECS 491A into high-fidelity designs, ensuring
alignment with user needs and enhancing user experience.

## Tasks
1. Refinement of Designs:
   - Transition each low-fidelity design developed in Figma to a high-fidelity version.
   - Focus on the aesthetic elements, including color schemes, typography, and detailed UI components.
2. User Interface and Experience Flow:
   - Finalize the user interface, ensuring it is intuitive and user-friendly.
   - Map out and refine the user experience flow to ensure smooth navigation and interaction.
3. Validation Against User Requirements:
   - Assess and validate the high-fidelity designs against the user requirements identified in previous milestones.
   - Incorporate any feedback or insights gained from user feedback.

## Deliverables
1. [Figma project](https://www.figma.com/design/NUDRs01QWl8D5Ca1PlhFGa/High-Fidelity-Prototype?node-id=0-1&p=f&t=MAHootb5qA0zTmbp-0):
   - A Figma link containing the high-fidelity designs of your application.
   - Ensure the assets are well-organized with clear naming conventions for ease of assessment.
2. [Design Justification Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dct7iAX81LqvuwVzXiehv-7XPur79W-0aB0ytEmymUY/edit?usp=sharing) (Team):
   - A comprehensive report (3-5 pages) detailing the rationale behind the design choices.
   - Include discussions on how the high-fidelity designs address user needs and improve upon the low-fidelity versions.
   - Explain any design changes made based on user feedback or market trends
3. [Peer Evaluation and Individual Contribution ](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vvPT6Y7rMUsc-U8fNtSXXovSr6J91OICcc763ILCWPg/edit?usp=sharing) (1 page maximum) :
   - Students assess each team memberâ€™s contributions, focusing on collaboration, communication, and quality of work.
   - This should be succinct, providing specific examples where possible.
   - Also include a statement about your contribution to that phase.

## Submission
- Submit the link to the Figma project and the Design Justification Report via canvas.
- Submit the report via Canvas and complete the peer review.
- Ensure all components are finalized and accessible for review by the submission deadline.

## Tip (s)
To enhance collaboration in this milestone within an Agile framework, consider incorporating practices like daily stand-ups, pair designing, and iterative feedback loops.
- Daily stand-ups will keep team members aligned on progress and obstacles.
- Pair designing allows for real-time collaboration and idea sharing in Figma.
- Iterative feedback loops, involving regular check-ins with peers for design critiques, ensure continuous improvement and alignment with user needs.
